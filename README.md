## Notes 
- [Using colors with Material-UI](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/blob/master/docs/src/pages/customization/themes/themes.md)
- Added the following
    - npm install --save react-redux
    - npm i redux
    - npm i ajv (for no other reason than to get rid of the warning)
 - **ASK LETI**: do we need Redux Thunk?  https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk
